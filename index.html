                    <li>SPOILER OF THE ABOVE STORY: A cub died. Oh? That's not much of a spoiler?</li><br>

                <p id="time">Monday, September 14, 2015</p>
                <p>Sorry with the "no posts" thing. We had a small vacation.<br><br>But, I did play Minecat, and this is what happened in Catopia:<br><br><strong><em>I got 3 extra dogs: Naru, Wolfy (a.k.a Oku), and their unnamed girl puppy.<br><br>Ori swam under the bridge and died. RIP Ori. I blame Sphynx for distracting me.<br><br>I got many, many more villagers. Yay...?<br><br>I got another horse. His name is Sein.</em></strong><br><br>Also, I was watching stacyplays'(s?) Shelter 2: Mountains, and I'm awaiting the final episode (RIP <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBILV8PElUw&list=PLc5xWgIisSO07BUVF4B21zzty5FlMoKtt&index=10">Peachy and Fleur</a>. May your dead aunties play with you in the stars). I wish the lynx family the best of luck in the forest fire (and may it not be a repeat of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBFqUoWAanQ&index=5&list=PLc5xWgIisSO0m8_2O1ftOfcq7CeNRS3e1">this</a>)<br><br>Oh, yes. Sphynx is panicking about his treats running out. To be honest, it's his fault. He's been doing the <em>"<a href="#fifty-ninth-post">jump-into-cabinet</a>"</em> thing again. And he's still failing most of the time. But, once, he knocked it out of the cabinet and ate it like mad. Then the humans confiscated his treats for a few days, but he only had a 6-ounce bag of treats left.<br><br>It's so fun, watching him fail at stealing treats, then moan endless at the fact he's kinda... un-bright in the head.<br><br>Lawl! (LOL)<br>=^.^=

                <p><em>On the first day of September...</em><br><br>Er, you did not just read that. Especially not in the tune of "12 Days of Christmas."<br><br>Anyway, I had found "eaglions," which are amazing creatures I discovered only today. Their front half is an eagle, and their rear half is a lion.<br><br><em>*Quiet whispers from Kitsune*</em><br><br>Oh. Kitsune tells me those are called "griffins" by the human race. But that means... No, that can't be true. IT CAN'T!<br><br>Did the humans really find them before me?!?!<br><br><em>*Heavy panting*</em><br><br>Nah. They couldn't have. They haven't even gone past the moon yet with rockets with people inside. Though with Sieger's time machine, I guess it's possible that he gave one to the humans ages ago...<br><br>Ugh. Not another meddling dog.<br><br>Umm... What's some cheerful news?<br><br>NO! I can't think of any good news! It was raining for ages (like, an hour) yesterday!

                <p id="time">Monday, August 31, 2015</p>
                <p>I had forgotten about my blog's seven-monthiversary! How could I? I even posted then! GAH! I blame <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/a12thdw/">the dog that bothers me so much</a>.<br><br>And Sphynx. Curse you, black cat.<br><br>Also, two people claimed to find my diary, WhiteShadow and Sieger. May I tell you again my diary is in a top-secret area? With super-high security? No one can read it (except me! Ha-ha-ha!).<br><br>Also, I had discovered two interesting games: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc5xWgIisSO0cSEnl1ej2sdbdxOUTnC0X">Ori and the Blind Forest</a>; and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc5xWgIisSO07BUVF4B21zzty5FlMoKtt">Shelter 2</a> (Thank you, stacyplays. I quite like your videos). The storylines for both may not be the best, but the graphics were quite attractive. Shelter 2 had quite a touching bit. You name the lynx cubs, and when you fail to protect them, they die with a heart-wrenching mewl-yowl sound.<br><br>And I had even more attachment to them because lynxes are wild cats. I feel so sad when the babies die (RIP <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVDItxaNVA8&list=PLc5xWgIisSO07BUVF4B21zzty5FlMoKtt&index=3">Lynk</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCiJqfhgnlA&list=PLc5xWgIisSO07BUVF4B21zzty5FlMoKtt&index=6">Peach</a>. May the stars light your path).<br><br>Now for Catopia! I got a horse (ORI!), seven wolves (Rosie, Hunter, Caesar, Sunny, Lupus, Skye, and Daniel), and a blacksmith villager I call Greedy-Pants (but don't all villagers give rip-off trades?). I found diamonds, got an enchanting table (that gives hardly any enchants; what?), and made an interesting enchanting room. The guardians aren't bothering me much, now that I have Ori with me.<br><br>Interestingly enough, I have a lot of saddles and horse armor, but only one horse. I found a horse island, but it's so far away. What to do?!?!<br><br>Oh, I met an Artic Fox named Kitsune. She's a new space-exploration friend of mine. She's helping me with my space fleet and exploration of space on my lovely ship "HMS Bast," with the "HMS" standing for Her Majesty's (meaning "MY") Ship.<br><br>Life is good. Good is life. Food is good. Food is life...<br><br>FORTY-TWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! (Don't mind my sheer randomness, people.)

                <p>Okay, I confess I like Nyan Cat and Starkit's Prophecy, but who doesn't laugh at Starkit's Prophecy while they read it? Besides...<br><br>That diary is a troll diary! It's not my real one! :P<br><br>Yes, Sieger, that's true. My diary is in the most protected area on a certain planet. But I won't tell you its name. Ha.<br><br>Anyway, if you read the post below this one, you'd know the links did not work for a little bit. Do you know why? It wasn't because of the KA team...<br><br>It was Sphynx! I caught him recoding the HTML thing so that my blog could never work again! Ever! Can you believe him? But due to this, quite a few other blogs went dead (*akkk*).<br>Now links are working properly, and everything is going well...<br><br>Well, not really.<br><br>Sphynx has been hiding in the bathroom half the time, because the vaccuum is out! It's not even on! But he is absolutely terrified by it (proves even further that he's not so bright), and the only thing that soothes him is toilet baths (ewww...). And just yesterday he was nearly- well, actually, I won't say what happened. But I will say he had to take quite a few baths (with extra shampoo) afterwards, which he suprisingly hates. <br><br>Now I can endlessly tease him about how flower-y he smells (he doesn't like flowers) and watch him hiss, then run when he realises that the vaccuum is right behind me (off, of course. I'm not <em>dumb</em>, you know).<br><br>Ha-ha-ha-ha! Too funny to watch. :)<br><br>P.S: Celebration! Links are working perfectly! I must tell <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/MinaWantsCookies/">Ayaka</a>!

                <p>I recently made up a few starter Pokemon on paper, and I made them real with "borrowed" technology from Sieger. They're pretty cute, but the last thing I want is the humans realizing that Pokemon are real now.

                <p>On planet Sylvan, I first saw they had advanced in technology more than Earth has in a thousand. In a mere five years, they went from hardly having a wheel to holographic telephones, teleporters, and tablets that are a gazillion times faster (and more useful) than human computers. Wow.<br><br>Now, Sieger, what do you NOW think of Sylveons, eh?<br><br>I met Sylvester, a shiny Sylveon in charge of the power for all the stuff they have. Turns out he has a crush on Silver... I don't know what to think, but they're both still on Sylvan for now. Maybe they'll both come with me to Earth, so Ayaka can meet Sylvester (she met Silver already). Sylvester also gave me a rare moonstone that refects your mood as well as light.<br><br>I'm sending that moonstone to Mittens. I hope she'll like it. It's so shiny and beautiful...<br><br>I'm back on Earth now, and Sphynx had refused to give back my diary. I think I know why, but I'm not telling you guys for a good reason, though I'm sure you can guess...<br><br>Thank you, Sphynx, for ruining my happiness. <span style="color:Red"><em>Cattail.</em></span><br><br>

                <p><strong>The Catopia:</strong><br><br>I'm building a large wooden bridge to an ocean monument (darn those Guardians! Too many lasers to dodge!!!) and another small island (my animal-and-wheat farm in the near future).<br><br>With the dungeons, I'm farming zombies and spiders like mad. I also go fishing for delicious salmon and weird pufferfish (I have two, I think). I am now hunting for diamonds and lava (I found lava today. I hope I don't fall in...)<br><br>Also, I got a nametag. If I get a wolf, what do you guys want me to name it?<br>(The two wolves from before disappeared. I reckon the went back to report to their "master.")<br><br><strong>Space Exploration Part 2:</strong><br><br>Well,  Sieger, I DID visit planet Hubris, so don’t deny it.<br><br>Anyway, the Flareons gave me a fragment of their precious Amber-Ember (it's the heart of their home; without it, Hubris would be uninhabitable) so I can remember them forever. I now have the polished "gems" made from the fragment imbedded in my collar. It looks like amber, but behaves more like blue amber (yes, it's real), but it glows at night only, with brilliant ghostly-blue star-light.<br><br>I visited planet Eevol (pronounced "Evil", but the Eevees aren't evil), which is the home planet of the Eevee race and their Evolutions. I learned Hubris (Fiery Pride of Flareons) is one of fifteen or so colony planets of Eevol, and I know the names of eight of those planets (minus Hubris):<br><br>Expersen (ESP Planet ruled by Espeons);<br>Sylvan (Fairy Forest with Sylveons);<br>Aquaria (Water Lands of Vaporeon);<br>Laurel (Leaf Age of the Leafeons);<br>Sombre (Umbreon Shadows);<br>Icicla (Snows of Glaceons);<br>Voltic (Electric Currents of Jolteons);<br>and Animalia (Land of Animals, with Eevee towns)<br><br> I'm currently heading to Sylvan with my Sylveon friend Silver, and I will post some of the incidents that may happen here by next week...<br><br>Now, where did Sphynx hide my diary?<br><br>

My vengence!)<br><br>So, he tried to get into the treat cabinet to eat all his (and MY) treats while the humans were outside shopping, I think. He leaped onto the countertop and jumped at the cabinet door-thing. He bonked his head HARD (he does it a lot; no wonder he isn't very bright), but the cabinet-door-thing opened.<br><br>Sphynx leapt into the cabinet to drag out his treats (and MY TREATS), but he hit the cabinet too hard while landing, and the door closed.<br><br>Sphynx is very afraid of the dark, and he loses all sense he has. He panicked and yowled his head off, demanding for someone to save him (a damsel in distress, NOT!). However, I can't leap as well as he can, and I follow the rules of "No Counter Jumping," so I left him alone after telling him to push the door-thingy open.<br><br>But he couldn't hear me over the noise HE was making, so he was stuck there until the humans came back.

                <p>Yep, you you read that right.<br>Didn't imagine me blogging about swimming, did you?<br><br>But I do have a love for water, other than flushing bugs into the sewer. =^.^=<br>Being an American Shorthair descendant, I like to swim. And with the hot weather moving in, I'm glad for my swimming ability.<br><br>The pool opens on May 9th. Which is only 3 more days. But my humans wait about a week, so if someone get chemical burns, it's not them. Great plan, yes?<br><br>Too bad the pool doesn't allow cats to swim in it (or dogs, heh-heh). Maybe I can pass myself as a very furry baby...<br><br>But I'll watch them. Like how Stevens and Marmalade do...<br><br><a href="http://strawpoll.me/4296797">Vote here if you think I am weird in the head.</a><br><small>Thanks to Buter for finding the site.

It's acually dedicated to our family, but you could show it as a one-day-late gift.<br>But anyway, I meant to blog yesterday, but it was busy. We went outside, too, so I couldn't slip away unnoticed. So unfair.<br>But we got some stuff to eat (Honor J gave me some bits of burger), I met Buddy's annoying brother Mickey (I call him Mickey Mouse, ha-ha), I got a catnip-tuna heart treat, and Honor J tried the Survival Games on PE. She died about a minute after the bloodbath, and then it was time for bed. She'll be trying again today, so if you have PE, she might see you (Username for Honor J: HonorJ; if you want her to know, you might want to post your username in the PE game on her programs. <em>THIS IS MY PROGRAM; SHE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT IT</em>)! <br><br>So, how was your Valentine's Day? Did something WEIRD happen? If you got an interesting story to tell, start a blog yourself! You could base it off this blog, or design it from scratch like I did.

                <p id="time">Friday, February 13, 2015</p>
                <p>WHEEE! I mean, oh no. Acually, I don't. But today is Friday... the 13th.<br>Okay, I said I might post a Warriors fanfic, but at the moment, I can't find ANY. So I got this little black cat story for you. Fits the theme nicely, huh?<br><br>
                <em>"Mama? What's going on?" I mewled in fright. My brother picked up the question as well. Mother looked down at us and sighed.<br><br>"It's adoption day," Mother said. "You're going to have families." I looked at her, shocked.<br><br>"But I want to stay with you," I whimpered. Mother purred softly, more to comfort than to happiness.<br><br>"Not likely," she murmured. "I am a black cat. Humans seem to not like black cats."<br><br>"But why don't they love you?" my brother asked, pressing against her. Mother sighed grimly.<br><br>"I don't know, but I can tell you my story." My brother and I glanced at each other and nodded.<br><br>"A long time ago, when I was your age, I was with my mama, and it was also adoption day. I hoped to have a family, someone who wasn't as mean and grumpy as my mama.<br><br>"Then the people came in. A little girl went up to me and said, 'Kitty!' I felt that I might get a home. But then her parents came over, took one glance at me, and hurried their kit over to the kitten across from me.<br><br>"I couldn't understand why. I was good. I was nice. Why didn't they want me?<br><br>"Even my mother got adopted, and only fifteen cats remained in the shelter. Ten of them were black cats like me. And those were how many there were before. None of us got adopted.<br><br>"Many adoption days passed, and I still was not adopted. I only got a glance or so before they went off to find a different-colored cat. Loneliness filled me.<br><br>"Then I met your father. He was a orange tabby, and was nice to me, unlike all the other cats. I had two kits before you, and then was expecting you two, but my first kits and mate were adopted. I wasn't as lonely as I was before because I knew I had you, but my one true love, my mate, was torn from me.<br><br>"I hoped you two would be adopted, because both of you are not black-colored. You will have happy homes, maybe together." Mother stopped and said, "The people are coming; act cute."<br><br>My brother and I mewled, batted the catnip mouse, and purred. Two kids came up two us, smiles on their faces. They ran to their parents, who then came over. The parents smiled at us and then looked at Mother. The parents glanced at each other, then called the guy that fed us. The feeder opened our cage, and the kids took me and my brother out.<br><br>I looked at Mother. She looked at me hard, as if she wanted to memorize every bit of me. Then, something interesting happened.<br><br>The parents took Mother out as well, fondled her, cuddled her. Surprise was on Mother's face, as well as gratefullness. After all, she got adopted.<br><br>And we were going home together. As a family.
                </em><br><br>Okay, I added the spacing. But it was all Honor J's writing from when she was ten. I think it's a good piece of work she made, so I put it here. I hope you like it.<br><br>And some interesing things happened yesterday. You remember Buddy? He did his business on his human friend's welcome mat. Well, the plastic bag that held his business was left on the ground (how gross!) and Honor J's friend Robin (No real names allowed here, and I'm hungry) tossed that thing into Buddy's place. Through the open second floor window.<br>Humans are grosser than dogs, sometimes.</p>

                <p id="time">Thrusday, February 12, 2015</p>
                <p>*Yawn*<br>Gee, I'm tired. But no one's down here, so I got to blog...<br><br>And so, yesterday, some INTERESING stuff happened... I was there. On a harness. Like Rudolph. *sigh*<br><br>Ravenstrike got in a fight. Marmalade, which is NOT her real name, was in his territory. He doesn't like other cats in his territory (except me, but I think it's because I smell like Honor J). Silly Marmalade. She got a nasty surprise... Ravenstrike knocked her over, so her belly was up. EXPOSED.<br>She ran away. Good riddance. I don't like her.<br><br>The dog across my house, Buddy (his nickname), came out with his human friend (cats are the masters of humans; dogs are the humans' best buds). Buddy did some weird things, including, after the two hours he spend outside barking "CAT!" to me, Ravenstrike, and this black-and-white cat who I call Tuxie (not her real name; she's named after a cookie), he did his business on his human friend's welcome mat. I mean, really, why do that? You want to look good in front of the humans! (You can do it when THEY aren't looking and blame it on your brother, Buddy)<br>And he tried to eat chalk (never succeeded), ran away from bubbles, and walked like a human.<br><br>By the stars in the sky, readers, some dogs are too weird to comprehend.<br><br>And Honor J read this: <a href="http://www.catster.com/lifestyle/cat-humor-behavior-questions-dying-to-ask">10 Questions I Am Dying to Ask My Cats</a>. It's a good article, I believe, for a cat owner to show her questions about cats.<br>And I have MY answers (it varies from cat to cat).<br><br><em>"Do you tire of eating the same food? I mean every. Single. Meal."</em><br>Of course I do. But it tastes good. Like chicken. And I always snatch some roast chicken.<br><br><em>"Why does the sound of the fridge water dispenser drive you crazy?"</em><br>THAT THING IS WORSE THAN THE MONSTER CLEANER (vacuum)!<br><br><em>"What propels you to fight each other?"</em><br>Private matters; keep out, Mom.<br><br><em>"Do you really think you can catch the laser?"</em><br>Meh. Some do, some not. I do it to amuse you.<br><br><em>"Do you love sleeping that much, or do you do it to pass the time?"</em><br>Yes, we LOVE sleeping. Every single cat loves to sleep, right?<br><br><em>"Are you jealous we can wear different clothes while you’re stuck in the same coat?"</em><br>I think it's silly that you change your coats. Having one coat is sooo much more practical.<br><br><em>"Does it hurt when you wake up in a weird position?"</em><br>What? No! We are amused by the "bizarre positions" we fall asleep in.<br><br><em>"Do you really think I’m your mom even though you are a cat and I’m not?"</em><br>You adopted us. That makes you Mom.<br><br><em>"Do you know your name?"</em><br>'Course I do. Except, sometimes... we ignore you.<br><br><em>"How do you really feel about dogs?"</em><br>Does it hate cats? Does it bark like mad? Is it a Chihuahua? If the answer to all of the above is yes, I don't care about the dog. It's okay.<br><br>And thanks for reading! Maybe I'll post a fanfic Honor J wrote. The dedication said, "To Riverstar and Jera Miller."</p>

                <p id="time">Wednesday, February 11, 2015</p>
                <p>I meant to publish this yesterday, but I went on my first walk outside. It wasn't too bad...<br><br>Except I did need to wear one of those harnesses. I'm no Rudolph, you know!<br><br>Anyways, this is my 30th or thirtieth post! I did not think I could last this long on blogging originally, but I made it (next goal: fifty posts!).<br>And it's awesome that you guys visit, even if I'm not on the hot list. I think the weather's being nice, 'cause it hasn't rained since my last "Dear Weather" post.<br>The answers to my previous post will come out when I get some more answers. Sorry, but I NEED those answers! I am going to post those answers from the comments up here as well.<br><br>But, hey, guys! I SAID this WAS a 30th special...<br><br>So I'll tell you some things about me, me, me, and some interesting things.<br><br>I was born some time ago (never gonna tell you! I'm a QUEEN) to a tabby American-British-Shorthair and a father I never knew, because he was adopted before I was born.<br>I had four littermates, Anubis, Namara ("Wolves of the Beyond" name, go look), Pellimore ("Guardians of Ga'Hoole"), and Whiskers. I was the oldest, and took care of my littlest brother Whiskers from all the teasing he got for being small.<br><br>But, only a little while back, we all got adopted, even Mama Fritha. I haven't seen any one of them since then, but I don't miss 'em so much (silent sobs for Whiskers, I do miss you so).<br>But one day, on January 30th, I got a new buddy, Sphynx. He was named that because we all THOUGHT he was a Sphynx, but turns out he's a mix (he grew some very, very short black fur)! Yes, no hoity-toity pedigree here!<br><br>And here's how I started blogging: I heard Honor J say, "Wow, a project blog. Too bad I've got nothing to write about. Oh well, I'll go write some more stories." But unlike her, cats got EVERYTHING to blog about. It's just we're lazy or shy or lazy or lazy or lazy...<br>But you get the point.<br>And Honor J is a great writer. She reads me her stories when she writes a part of it and asks my opinion! She's amazing... And her hiking shoes have very nice shoelaces...<br><br>And maybe you should vist my three buddies: <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/the-sinister-snake-blog/5805103010021376">Snake</a>, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/its-a-dogs-life/5385655958634496">Sieger</a>, and <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/its-a-butterflys-life/5799566797176832">Buter</a> (I pronouce it as Budder) when I'm off. They're all good (I mean a <em>snake and a dog</em> got my approval. It's hard!) and they know me. They write along with me and we have linked blogs... So give them a go!<br>And "The World of Bast" will come out this month, and I hope you look foward to it. (Thanks, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/its-a-cats-life/6592182811885568?qa_expand_key=ag5zfmtoYW4tYWNhZGVteXJpCxIIVXNlckRhdGEiRnVzZXJfaWRfa2V5X2h0dHA6Ly9pZC5raGFuYWNhZGVteS5vcmcvNmVlNjFjYzc0MzExNGZlOGIzZTI3NDYyYTQ3ODY4MTMMCxIIRmVlZGJhY2sYgICAgPT-iwoM">LebosiLebosi</a> for the idea.)<br><br>And I am sorry about my inactivity. Humans, sunshine, FOOD... They are factors here!</p>

                <p id="time">Sunday, February 8, 2015</p>
                <p>Hey everyone, Bast here, from someplace in America...<br><br>Okay, I admit it, over the last four days, my humans have been watching a LOT of DanTDM. It's starting to rub on me TOO much for my liking...<br>But that's not the point. We watched his "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhfDzYfO2O0">25 Things About Me</a>" Vlog (video blog?), and I decided to do an article with 20 true things about me and 5 FALSE.<br>Try to guess the false ones. And starting with one...<br>
                <ol>
                    <li>I like chicken more than fish. Weird, right? But true (or is it...?).</li>
                    <li>I like swimming. Nope, no Coon in me, so no Toilet Pool Parties!</li>
                    <li>I have American Shorthair and Britsh Shorthair blood. I do (hence my distant cousin Jemma).</li>
                    <li>I turn on the faucet by myself and watch all the flies drown in the waterfall.</li>
                    <li>Tuna tastes weird to me. Like a burrito with a gallon of milk on top.</li>
                    <li>Speaking of milk, I don't like milk either. I'm so un-cat-like! WAHHH!</li>
                    <li>I lick some gravy from the gravy boat when the people aren't looking.</li>
                    <li>CATNIP IS AWESOME!!! IT HEALS THE ILL ME!!! (Oops, think you knew that.)</li>
                    <li>Meowing is the easiest way for me to get everything EXCEPT what I want. So sad.</li>
                    <li>Sleeping is my favorite hobby. SO cat-like. *purr*</li>
                    <li>Sunlight is THE MOST important thing to me. After that, food.</li>
                    <li>I am hyperactive. Like a kid that drank a half-gallon of soda.</li>
                    <li>I can eat chocolate. Without getting sick. But I hate it. Oh the irony!</li>
                    <li>My favorite random number is round(random(0, 100)). Hope you understand.</li>
                    <li>Stampy is my favorite Youtuber, 'cause he's a Minecatian cat. =^.^=</li>
                    <li>I hunt bugs, including roaches. They taste like shrimp.</li>
                    <li>I know how to play Minecat and Spore. But not Catlateral Damage.</li>
                    <li>Squaishy Quack is truly a chicken, not a duck, to me. *rumbling tummy*</li>
                    <li>Kopi is my favorite dog. I love that one dog. She's cute.</li>
                    <li>I see in all colors well.</li>
                    <li>I eat my veggies. OM-NOM-NOM!</li>
                    <li>Gold, mantequilla, and butter (or budder) all taste the same to me.</li>
                    <li>I plan for world domination by Friday. And fail. =T.T=</li>
                    <li>Thinknoodles is awesome and is my second favorite with DanTDM.</li>
                    <li>I can smile. And yawn like nobody's business. Oh, wait, it's not their business.</li>
                </ol>
                So what are false and what are true? Tell me in the Tips and Thanks if you guess. (FIVE FALSE. JUST FIVE)

I need some catnip. *cough-cough*) I'm alright, I think, but I can't use the computer very often, my humans are watching SO much Minecat I can't resist going there to watch with them (THINKNOODLES!!!), and it's sunny.<br><br>I'll be baaaack.<br>By Sunday.

                <p>Okay, yesterday, I was sunbathing with Sphinx. (It was finally sunny!) Anyway, I was too happy in the sun-puddle to blog, so sorry. Sphinx updated it for me (Just Mysty's name).<br>Oh, I'll be a little less active now, as it is sunny. I'll blog more on the Sunday-Wednesday time period. So hold on, there'll be more!

                <p>Dear Weather,<br><br>It rained. AGAIN. For the fourth time in a row! You have recieved my letters (yes, I asked the post office. They said it was going to where you are: Kansas), but still did NOTHING to give me sun.<br>My new buddy Sphinx wants to see the sun. He never saw it in this area. No siree. Sooo, can you guess who I'm hurling to you? Yep, it's that snake, Snake (Apophis, ha-ha). SHE (yes, I thought she was a he, too) will shred those clouds to teeny-weeny bits. And then it can be a desert again.<br>=^.^=<br><br>Love (not really),<br>Bast<br><br>P.S.: The "Gecko" turned out to be one of those venomous lizards. Oops.<br>P.P.S: I sent the snake a hundred mice.

And there doesn't seem to be much hard work on that.<br>But I'm glad you all supported me, all 162+ people. I got recognized and may have inspired others to work like I have. I have so much, and I can't help but smile everytime I come to see this blog. Thank you all.<br><br>And, guys, do you want me to make another program? HTML or Javascript?

                <p>I am coughing a LOT recently. At first, I though I was coming down with whitecough (not fun), but then Ravenstrike told me it was furball season for many cats here.<br>But furballs horrify me.<br>I mean, how would you like to give out orders, acting all regal and things, then suddenly, you spit out a lump of fur/hair? It's embarassing and frustrating! It stresses me out! I want to be clean, but to spit out giant furballs? No, I don't want to. Sunbaths, then HUMAN grooming, is sooo much better.<br><br>I mean, who wouldn't love to mess themselves up and then let their human-pet fix them right up? Mew-mew-meow.<br>(And what's a "Cheezburger"? Sounds like tuna and catnip to me.) =^.^=

                <p>Yes! My dream of getting over 120 votes and being fourth on the hot list is achieved! Humans (and cats and dog) that voted and liked this blog, I say thanks. You will be treated well when I rule with Retiever-German Shepherd. (He really needs to tell his name to me. Then I can pretend he is a cat.)<br>Once again, thanks. I feel kinda gloomy do to the WEATHER (and it's furball season for me *hakk-hakk*), but I really feel better when I read any of your comments.<br>I appeciate all the votes, and hope to be the most popular blog here with 150 or so votes... But it's not necessary. I love this the way it is.<br><br>The Retiever-German Shepherd said snow is "fluffy white stuff that has been known to make cats go wild playing with the stuff." That is so WEIRD! There's only one thing that could cause ME to go wild- white, fluffy catnip-tuna kibble. Yum.<br>And I live in a desert. I don't EVER see snow.

                <p>I know a grand total of two (maybe three, "Catlateral Damage" included?) video games. I mean that's a LOT, right?.<br>One is called "Spore," which you may not know of, and "Minecraft," which about 99% of you know (Minecraft is really MINECAT!). Spore is a game where you evolve your tiny bug-thing into an acual critter, to a tribe of critters, to a civilization, to a "space-faring" race (What's space?). I'll leave my favorite YouTube playlists of Spore plus its "wiki" (What's that?).<br>Anywho, I know only PC Minecraft and PE Minecraft. What's an Xbox? I don't know what's that... Oh wait, is that the one Thinknoodles knocked over in Catlateral Damage? *watches his video again* Nope, it's a Nintendo or something. That's too bad. I wanted to see him break an Xbox and shred to teeny-weeny pieces...<br>=^.^=

                <p id="time">Wednesday, January 28, 2015</p>
                <p>I honestly don't know much about him. But at least one of you wants something about him, and here I go.<br>He is one of the most popular kid-friendly Minecatian YouTubers. He supposedly DID cuss on some of his first videos, then realised many of his followers were human kittens. Then he made a "swear chest" so that he would keep honest.<br>And he must have made a cake sometime, because I remember Thinknoodles's video with some famous Minecatian YouTubers there. A yellow banana thing stole Stampy's cake, and Thinknoodles ate the cake because he was starving (I think). Then Think made another cake and put IT in the museum. :P<br>Total weirdness...<br>And noodle cake... Yum... Just need some tuna...

                <p>The retriever (oh, pardon, German Shepherd-Retriever Mix) had offered to co-rule with me. I had thought for many hours (2 of them) to come up with an answer. And then I read his blog again and realised that he wanted to rule the <em>galaxy</em> rather than the <em>universe</em>.<br>So, buddy, how about I become the supreme ruler of the universe and you ruler of the universe (I am its Queen. You are its <em>Prince</em>.)? Isn't that fair?<br>And I hope you have a nice day.

Do you think it is fair?<br>NO, IT'S NOT! Do you know the <em>most regal cat in the world (and your future ruler)</em> lives here? And how many OTHER cats? And dogs?<br>If you must make it rain, make it rain catnip. Or tuna. But not <em>rain.</em> If you must make clouds, make them out of fluffy stuff, like my cat's bed. I want to sleep on them.<br>And Weather, what's snow?<br><br>Love (not really),<br>Bast<br><br>P.S.: I WANT CATNIP!!!

Maybe I'll take over the GALAXY or UNIVERSE before the Retriever* does. Take that, dogs!<br>I plan to blog a lot. And I will blog about everything and add a humorous twist! And I recommend going to Catster (see the links) to see where I got my inspiration to blog and blog and blog and blog and blog and blog. *hakk-hakk-HAKK* Furballs. Again. My only weakness.<br>But I'm happy and excited, and you should be, too. You need to smile, 'cause we cats are awesome. =^.^=<br>Meowza! Mew! Yeah!

                <p>Dear Weather,<br><br>Why must you be so infuriating? Yesterday it RAINED! And there was no sun all day! I couldn't take my sunbath and had to settle with only a grooming. That's no way to treat a queen, you know.<br>I am sending this letter so that you could make it sunny EVERYWHERE FOREVER. It is only proper that you give sun to all the cats (and humans, I guess) in the world. We need that sun for our sunbaths, and without the sun, there's no catnip! I need catnip! CATNIP!<br><br>Love (not really),<br>Bast<br><br>P.S.: I really hate rain. So don't make it rain.

                <p>Ravenstrike is acually the cat my human made here on KA. It is based off the stray that lives in the neighborhood (I hate him). I know NOTHING about Warriors myself, but my human knows practically everything, I think. But anyway, I want no true name to be revealed to the world except mine.<br>So his name is Ravenstrike here. And I still hate him for trying to steal my humans, being all purry and happy with them.<br>Grrawr.

And I like "It's a Dog's Life." I found out how similar we are (maybe not) and I like dogs a little (I still don't likie).<br>And I'll start something called "Dear Weather," in my blog as a treat to you guys.<br>Am I really that popular?

It's coo-coo this, or cooo-coo that. And did I mention they did not run from cats? They're like a walking, flying buffet. But do you know what's horrible?<br><br>I CAN'T EAT THEM! I'm stuck inside.

                <p>Ever wondered what was going on in a cat's head? Well, here's ten:<br>1: Food. When is it breakfast? Or lunch? Or dinner? Or snacktime?<br>2: Sleeping. *YAWN* Time for bed.<br>3: Boxes. Is the mail here yet?<br>4: Food. Is it breakfast yet? Or lunch? Or dinner? Or snacktime?<br>5: Food. I'm starving here!<br>6: Thinking. Should I stay on this side or the other? This or other...<br>7: Catnip. Mmmm... CATNIP!!!! Gimme my catnip! I've been a good kitty! (Not)<br>8: Grooming. A queen's gotta be clean, am I right?<br>9: SLEEPING IN BOXES AFTER EATING AND CATNIP. That's heaven.<br>10: Humans. I'm too lazy to feed myself, their laps are so cozy, and they're funny.<br>Does that match what you think of us?

                <p>I watch things on YouTube. Cats acting ridiculous. Cas being cats. Cats acting like dogs (horrifying, right?). But my favorite is Thinknoodles's Catlateral Damage. He acts like a true cat. He knocked over EVERYTHING. Flower pots, plates, water bottles, garbage cans, shoes, hangers, and best of all, their electronics (TV, computers, gaming console, that stuff). He is a true cat on the inside and he shows it. I envy him. But then again, I'm afraid the humans will kick me out if I, errm, wreck their house.<br>AND HOW SHALL I BLOG IF THE COMPUTER'S DEAD?<br>Anyways, I watch a lot of Minecraft, due to my humans' addiction to the game. I only saw Thinknoodles and TheDiamondMinecart when it comes to kid-friendly Minecraftian YouTubers. But I know there's more... Somewhere.<br>But these guys are awesome. I'd never stop watching these guys, even if they both are dog-lovers and at least one is allergic to cats. Miarr.<br>Now, pick up your chopsticks and hit that vote button! (No, it's not necessary. But I likie.)

Sorry.<br>Anyway, I had hacked into my human's account and did some amazing work. She cannot see this blog, nor delete it even if she finds it. But why should she suspect? I mean, it's not like she'll get ALL the comments I get here. And who would hate such a cute kitty? Mrrow? =^.^=<br>Oh, let's make it clear. I blog when I want. No votes are necessary. Though I would appreciate the votes, comments, visits, etc., I don't need them to blog. I'm just a cat with a dream of dominating the world. I don't need votes. (Acually, I do. I just blog independently.)<br> Did I just repeat myself?
